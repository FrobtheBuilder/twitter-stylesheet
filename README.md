# twitter-stylesheet
Twitter stylesheet to make the main column wider and images less rounded.
Based on the "Better Twitter Redesign" stylesheet by duncannah, but much closer to the default look.

## Installing
Install the [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) extension for your browser. Do NOT use Stylish because it contains malware.
